### Active Assignments
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills and tools youâ€™ll be using every day is vital to your success.
Work through the assignments and readings listed below. Learn and research the language and its potential. For many of you, 
this is a brand new language, and it is important for you to become familiar with it and really understand the differences between C# and 
every other language out there. Learn and determine why one would choose C# for a project over another.   

You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
Spread it out evenly to do a bit every day before the first day of class.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.
