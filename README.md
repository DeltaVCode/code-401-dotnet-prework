# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in ASP.NET Core

## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: ASP.NET Core that counts up to 5% of your grade.
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.
The prework should take you approx 15-20 hours to complete.

Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

**Note: All prework is due the Friday before the class starts at 6pm**

### Reference Materials:
- Optional - [C# 7.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference](https://www.amazon.com/C-7-0-Nutshell-Definitive-Reference/dp/1491987650/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504228723&sr=8-1&keywords=C%23+7.0+in+a+Nutshell) 
	- This book is a great resource both in class, and after graduation for reference on the most up to date C# features. Use this book to obtain guidance on C# terminology and how to use specific components of the language.

### Active Assignments
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills and tools youâ€™ll be using every day is vital to your success.
Work through the assignments and readings listed below. Learn and research the language and its potential. For many of you, 
this is a brand new language, and it is important for you to become familiar with it and really understand the differences between C# and 
every other language out there. Learn and determine why one would choose C# for a project over another.   

You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
Spread it out evenly to do a bit every day before the first day of class.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.

### Career Coaching Prework
In addition to coding, Career Coaching is vital for developers to be successful. As developers, we should be taking our professional development just as seriously as our coding projects that we work on. The better we get at marketing and branding ourselves, the more natural finding new positions within our community will be. Within Canvas, there is a section for Career Coaching. Please review the posted assignments and their due dates, and be sure to complete them before the posted due dates. Career Coaching assignments will always treated like regular assignments and should be considered with just as much importance as lab and coding challenges.
