### Active Assignments
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills and tools youâ€™ll be using every day is vital to your success.
Work through the assignments and readings listed below. Learn and research the language and its potential. For many of you, 
this is a brand new language, and it is important for you to become familiar with it and really understand the differences between C# and 
every other language out there. Learn and determine why one would choose C# for a project over another.   

You do not need to do a lot of work every day.
Spread it out evenly to do a bit every day before the first day of class.
Do not let a day go by without spending your time practicing.

### Career Coaching Prework
In addition to coding, Career Coaching is vital for developers to be successful. As developers, we should be taking our professional development just as seriously as our coding projects that we work on. The better we get at marketing and branding ourselves, the more natural finding new positions within our community will be. Within Canvas, there is a section for Career Coaching. Please review the posted assignments and their due dates, and be sure to complete them before the posted due dates. Career Coaching assignments will always treated like regular assignments and should be considered with just as much importance as lab and coding challenges.
