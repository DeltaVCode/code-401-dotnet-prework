## Tasks

C# has gone through quite a few changes since its release in 2001. Spend a few minutes and read about the current state of C#,

#### Submitting Your Work
Once you complete the readings, continue onto the lab assignments but keep
the content of what you read into consideration as you work through the tutorials. 

Once you gain access to the Canvas course, there will be a "Technical Quiz" that you will be required to complete. This will
ask you basic questions about the readings and tutorials that were covered in the later prework tasks. 

This quiz is open note/open internet, but not open classmate. The quiz is *not timed* and you will only be given two attempts. Correct answers will not be visible between attempts. Use your 
resources during the quiz and take notes as you progress through the readings and tutorials.
