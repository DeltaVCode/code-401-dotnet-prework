# Prework - Readings

## Tasks
Read through the articles listed below and learn about C# and the .NET Core Framework. 
C# has gone through quite a few changes since its release in 2001. Spend a few minutes and read about the current state of C#,
how it has evolved, and a brief introduction to the brand new .NET Core. We will be using .NET Core in the class and building sites with this new technology. 

### History of .NET and C# (~35 min)
1. [The State of C#](cs.pdf) document (~15 min)
1. [C# Version History](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-version-history) (~10 min)
1. [.Net Core Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/) (~10 min)

#### Submitting Your Work
There will be a discussion assignment on Canvas focusing on the history and evolution of C# and the .NET Framework.
You are to post in that discussion assignment with your thoughts and reflections about these readings.
Responses should be **at least** 3-5 sentences for each article read (total 3 paragraphs).
Replies to others' comments are not mandatory but appreciated.

### C# Language (~2 hours)
1. C# 7.0 in a Nutshell:
	- Ch. 1: Introducing C# and the .NET Framework
	- Ch. 2:  C# Language Basics


#### Submitting Your Work
Once you complete the readings from the "C# 7.0 in a Nutshell" book, continue onto the Lab Assignments but keep
the content of what you read into consideration as you work through the tutorials. 

Once you gain access to the Canvas course, there will be a "Technical Quiz" that you will be required to complete. This will
ask you basic questions about both the 2 chapters in the book and the tutorials that were covered in the later prework tasks. 

This quiz is open note/open internet, but not open classmate. The quiz is *not timed* but you will only be given one attempt. Use your 
resources during the quiz and take notes as you progress through both the chapters and tutorials.
